- 👋 Hi, I’m @Wellconnectedlife
- 👀 I’m interested in ways to help my Apple users expedite their every day tasks. At the moment I'm focusing on Apple photos metadata
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about osxphotos.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing yet.
- 📫 How to reach me? I'm not sure how people communicate with each other on here yet. But if anybody knows how to help migrate Apple photos while retaining there album structure to a Nas, please let me know.
